Being inflexible might make things worse or cause chances to be lost. As disruption occurs, leaders should review and hone their vision to ensure that the team is aware of the most recent advancements.

For instance: when digital technology upended the entertainment sector, Netflix switched its emphasis from DVD rentals to streaming services. By making this change, the business was able to maintain an advantage over rivals and grow to dominate the streaming industry.

3. Promoting an Adaptable and Resilient Culture

Even in situations where the business had to make tough choices like layoffs, his staff came to trust him because of his honesty.

b) Give Frequent Updates

c) Promote Discussion and Input

5. Granting Autonomy to Teams
Leaders must empower their staff to take responsibility for their job and make decisions on their own because they are unable to handle all parts of disruption on their own. Giving workers more freedom encourages innovation, creativity, and a feeling of duty—qualities that are especially important in uncertain times.

During periods of transition, the firm was able to retain high customer satisfaction because to its autonomy.

c) Promote Originality

As an illustration: consider Amazon, which is renowned for encouraging its staff to experiment and come up with innovative ideas. This kind of thinking has assisted the business in navigating several market upheavals, such as cloud computing and online shopping.
